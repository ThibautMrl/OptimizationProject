This project was a succession of 3 practical works where we had to implement different minimisation algorithms and evaluate them on test functions in order to compare their performance.
List of implemented algorithms:
- Fixed step gradient descent
- Gradient descent with optimal step 
- Conjugate gradient (linear and non linear)
- Gradient with spectral step
